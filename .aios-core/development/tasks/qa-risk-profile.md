# risk-profile

Generate a comprehensive risk assessment matrix for a story implementation using probability × impact analysis.

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
  - story_path: 'docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.*.md'
  - story_title: '{title}' # If missing, derive from story file H1

## Risk Analysis Process

### 1. Risk Identification

For each category, identify specific risks:

```yaml
risk:
  id: 'SEC-001' # Use prefixes: SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS, TECH
  category: security
  title: 'Insufficient input validation on user forms'
  description: 'Form inputs not properly sanitized could lead to XSS attacks'
  affected_components:
    - 'UserRegistrationForm'
    - 'ProfileUpdateForm'
  detection_method: 'Code review revealed missing validation'
```

### 2. Risk Assessment

Evaluate each risk using probability × impact:

**Probability Levels:**

- `High (3)`: Likely to occur (>70% chance)
- `Medium (2)`: Possible occurrence (30-70% chance)
- `Low (1)`: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)

**Impact Levels:**

- `High (3)`: Severe consequences (data breach, system down, major financial loss)
- `Medium (2)`: Moderate consequences (degraded performance, minor data issues)
- `Low (1)`: Minor consequences (cosmetic issues, slight inconvenience)

### Risk Score = Probability × Impact

- 9: Critical Risk (Red)
- 6: High Risk (Orange)
- 4: Medium Risk (Yellow)
- 2-3: Low Risk (Green)
- 1: Minimal Risk (Blue)

### 3. Risk Prioritization

Create risk matrix:

```markdown
## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | XSS vulnerability       | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| PERF-001 | Slow query on dashboard | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Backup failure          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
```

### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

For each identified risk, provide mitigation:

```yaml
mitigation:
  risk_id: 'SEC-001'
  strategy: 'preventive' # preventive|detective|corrective
  actions:
    - 'Implement input validation library (e.g., validator.js)'
    - 'Add CSP headers to prevent XSS execution'
    - 'Sanitize all user inputs before storage'
    - 'Escape all outputs in templates'
  testing_requirements:
    - 'Security testing with OWASP ZAP'
    - 'Manual penetration testing of forms'
    - 'Unit tests for validation functions'
  residual_risk: 'Low - Some zero-day vulnerabilities may remain'
  owner: 'dev'
  timeline: 'Before deployment'
```

## Outputs

### Output 1: Gate YAML Block

Generate for pasting into gate file under `risk_summary`:

**Output rules:**

- Only include assessed risks; do not emit placeholders
- Sort risks by score (desc) when emitting highest and any tabular lists
- If no risks: totals all zeros, omit highest, keep recommendations arrays empty

```yaml
# risk_summary (paste into gate file):
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: X # score 9
    high: Y # score 6
    medium: Z # score 4
    low: W # score 2-3
  highest:
    id: SEC-001
    score: 9
    title: 'XSS on profile form'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Add input sanitization & CSP'
    monitor:
      - 'Add security alerts for auth endpoints'
```

### Output 2: Markdown Report

**Save to:** `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md`

```markdown
# Risk Profile: Story {epic}.{story}

Date: {date}
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

- Infrastructure: X risks

## Detailed Risk Register

[Full table of all risks with scores and mitigations]

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Test scenarios for critical risks
- Required test types (security, load, chaos)
- Test data requirements

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Integration test scenarios
- Edge case coverage

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests
- Regression test suite

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Document any risks team accepts
- Include sign-off from appropriate authority

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for PERF risks
- Security alerts for SEC risks
- Error rates for operational risks
- Business KPIs for business risks

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Architecture changes significantly
- New integrations added
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
- Regulatory requirements change
```

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

Calculate overall story risk score:

```text
Base Score = 100
For each risk:
  - Critical (9): Deduct 20 points
  - High (6): Deduct 10 points
  - Medium (4): Deduct 5 points
  - Low (2-3): Deduct 2 points

Minimum score = 0 (extremely risky)
Maximum score = 100 (minimal risk)
```

## Risk-Based Recommendations

Based on risk profile, recommend:

1. **Testing Priority**
   - Which tests to run first
   - Additional test types needed
   - Test environment requirements

2. **Development Focus**
   - Code review emphasis areas
   - Additional validation needed
   - Security controls to implement

3. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Phased rollout for high-risk changes
   - Feature flags for risky features
   - Rollback procedures

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Metrics to track
   - Alerts to configure
   - Dashboard requirements

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Deterministic gate mapping:**

- Any risk with score ≥ 9 → Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
- Else if any score ≥ 6 → Gate = CONCERNS
- Else → Gate = PASS
- Unmitigated risks → Document in gate

## Key Principles

- Identify risks early and systematically
- Use consistent probability × impact scoring
- Provide actionable mitigation strategies
- Link risks to specific test requirements
- Track residual risk after mitigation
- Update risk profile as story evolves
