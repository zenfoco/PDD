  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Service enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - API versioning or breaking changes needed
      - Database schema changes required
      - Performance or scalability improvements needed
      - Multiple integration points affected
    when_not_to_use:
      - New service from scratch (use greenfield-service)
      - Frontend enhancement (use brownfield-ui)
      - Full-stack enhancement (use brownfield-fullstack)
      - Comprehensive technical debt audit (use brownfield-discovery)
