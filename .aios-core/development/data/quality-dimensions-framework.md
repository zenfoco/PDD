# Quality Dimensions Framework

> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Source:** AIOS Quality Standards

Framework for evaluating squad outputs using multi-dimensional quality scoring.

---

## 1. Overview

A comprehensive quality assessment uses 10 standardized dimensions. Each dimension has:

- **Weight:** Relative importance (0.0-1.0)
- **Threshold:** Minimum acceptable score
- **Veto Power:** Whether low score blocks progress

## 4. Assessment Template

```yaml
quality_assessment:
  subject: 'What is being assessed'
  assessment_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  assessor: 'Who/what performed assessment'

  dimensions:
    - name: 'Accuracy'
      score: 0-10
      evidence: 'Supporting observations'
      recommendations: ['Improvements']

    - name: 'Coherence'
      score: 0-10
      evidence: 'Observations'
      recommendations: []

    # ... repeat for all 10 dimensions

  overall_score: number # Weighted average
  pass_threshold: 7.0
  status: 'PASS | FAIL | REVIEW'

  summary:
    strengths: ["What's working well"]
    weaknesses: ['What needs improvement']
    critical_issues: ['Blocking issues']
    recommendations: ['Prioritized actions']
```

---

## 5. Scoring Calculation

### Weighted Average Formula

```text
overall_score = Σ(dimension_score × weight) / Σ(weights)
```

### Pass/Fail Logic

```text
IF (overall_score >= 7.0 AND no_dimension < 6.0)
  THEN status = PASS
ELSE IF (any_veto_dimension < threshold)
  THEN status = FAIL
ELSE
  status = REVIEW
```

---

## 6. Domain-Specific Weights

Adjust weights based on domain:

### Software Development

```yaml
weights_override:
  accuracy: 1.0 # Code must work
  operational_excellence: 0.9
  risk_management: 0.9
  sustainability: 0.8
```

### Marketing/Copy

```yaml
weights_override:
  stakeholder_value: 1.0 # Must resonate with audience
  innovation_capacity: 0.9
  coherence: 0.9
```

### Operations/Process

```yaml
weights_override:
  operational_excellence: 1.0
  resource_optimization: 0.9
  risk_management: 0.9
```

---

## 7. Integration with Workflows

Add quality assessment as a checkpoint:

```yaml
checkpoint:
  id: 'quality-gate'
  type: 'quality_dimensions'
  phase: 'final'

  dimensions_to_evaluate: 'all' # or specific list

  thresholds:
    overall: 7.0
    per_dimension: 6.0

  veto_dimensions:
    - 'accuracy'

  pass_action: 'Approve and publish'
  fail_action: 'Return for revision'
  review_action: 'Escalate to human'
```

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement

Track scores over time:

```yaml
tracking:
  aggregate_by: ['month', 'quarter']
  metrics:
    - average_overall_score
    - dimension_averages
    - fail_rate
    - veto_rate
  alerts:
    - condition: 'average_score < 7.0'
      action: 'Review process quality'
```
