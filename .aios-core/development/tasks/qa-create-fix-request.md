# Create Fix Request Task

Generate a structured fix request document (`QA_FIX_REQUEST.md`) for @dev based on QA review findings.

---

## Execution Modes

**Choose your execution mode:**

### 1. YOLO Mode - Fast, Autonomous (0-1 prompts)

- Autonomous decision making with logging
- Minimal user interaction
- **Best for:** Simple, deterministic tasks

### 2. Interactive Mode - Balanced, Educational (5-10 prompts) **[DEFAULT]**

- Explicit decision checkpoints
- Educational explanations
- **Best for:** Learning, complex decisions

### 3. Pre-Flight Planning - Comprehensive Upfront Planning

- Task analysis phase (identify all ambiguities)
- Zero ambiguity execution
- **Best for:** Ambiguous requirements, critical work

**Parameter:** `mode` (optional, default: `interactive`)

## Pre-Conditions

**Purpose:** Validate prerequisites BEFORE task execution (blocking)

**Checklist:**

```yaml
pre-conditions:
  - [ ] QA report exists for the story
    tipo: pre-condition
    blocker: true
    validacao: |
      Check docs/stories/{story-id}/qa/qa_report.md exists

  - [ ] Story is in Review or Rejected status
    tipo: pre-condition
    blocker: false
    validacao: |
      Story should be in Review status for fix request
    error_message: "Warning: Story may not need fix request if not in Review status."
```

---

## Post-Conditions

**Purpose:** Validate execution success AFTER task completes

**Checklist:**

```yaml
post-conditions:
  - [ ] QA_FIX_REQUEST.md created with all issues
    tipo: post-condition
    blocker: true
    validacao: |
      Verify file created at docs/stories/{story-id}/qa/QA_FIX_REQUEST.md
    error_message: "Post-condition failed: QA_FIX_REQUEST.md was not created."

  - [ ] All CRITICAL and MAJOR issues included
    tipo: post-condition
    blocker: true
    validacao: |
      Verify issue count matches source report
    error_message: "Post-condition failed: Not all issues were included in fix request."
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Purpose:** Definitive pass/fail criteria for task completion

**Checklist:**

```yaml
acceptance-criteria:
  - [ ] Fix request generated with proper structure
    tipo: acceptance-criterion
    blocker: true
    validacao: |
      Assert fix request follows template structure
    error_message: "Acceptance criterion not met: Fix request structure invalid."

  - [ ] Each issue has location, problem, expected, verification
    tipo: acceptance-criterion
    blocker: true
    validacao: |
      Assert all required fields present for each issue
    error_message: "Acceptance criterion not met: Missing required issue fields."

  - [ ] Constraints section included
    tipo: acceptance-criterion
    blocker: true
    validacao: |
      Assert constraints checklist present
    error_message: "Acceptance criterion not met: Constraints section missing."
```

## Tools

**External/shared resources used by this task:**

- **Tool:** file-reader
  - **Purpose:** Read qa_report.md source file
  - **Source:** Native file system

- **Tool:** markdown-parser
  - **Purpose:** Parse QA report structure
  - **Source:** Native markdown processing

---

## Scripts

**Agent-specific code for this task:**

- **Script:** parse-qa-report.js
  - **Purpose:** Extract issues from QA report
  - **Language:** JavaScript
  - **Location:** .aios-core/development/scripts/parse-qa-report.js (optional)

---

## Error Handling

**Strategy:** fail-fast

**Common Errors:**

1. **Error:** QA Report Not Found
   - **Cause:** Story has not been reviewed yet
   - **Resolution:** Run \*review {story-id} first
   - **Recovery:** Provide clear instruction to user

2. **Error:** No Issues to Report
   - **Cause:** QA report shows all PASS
   - **Resolution:** No fix request needed
   - **Recovery:** Inform user story is ready for merge

3. **Error:** Invalid QA Report Format
   - **Cause:** QA report doesn't follow expected structure
   - **Resolution:** Re-run QA review
   - **Recovery:** List expected sections

---

## Performance

**Expected Metrics:**

```yaml
duration_expected: 1-3 min (estimated)
cost_estimated: $0.001-0.003
token_usage: ~500-1,500 tokens
```

**Optimization Notes:**

- Direct file parsing; minimal LLM usage; deterministic output

---

## Metadata

```yaml
story: 6.3
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - qa-review-story.md
tags:
  - quality-assurance
  - fix-request
  - qa-loop
updated_at: 2026-01-29

## Configuration Dependencies

This task requires the following configuration keys from `core-config.yaml`:

- **`qa.qaLocation`**: Location of QA files (typically docs/qa)
- **`devStoryLocation`**: Location of story files (typically docs/stories)

**Loading Config:**

```javascript
const yaml = require('js-yaml');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const configPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../.aios-core/core-config.yaml');
const config = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf8'));

const qa_location = config.qa.qaLocation;
const dev_story_location = config.devStoryLocation;
```

---

## Command

```
*create-fix-request {story-id} [--include-minor]
```

**Parameters:**

- `story-id` (required): Story identifier (e.g., "6.3")
- `--include-minor` (optional): Include Minor severity issues

**Examples:**

```bash
*create-fix-request 6.3
*create-fix-request 6.3 --include-minor
```

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Load QA Report

1. Locate the QA report file:

   ```
   docs/stories/{story-id}/qa/qa_report.md
   ```

2. If not found, check alternate locations:

   ```
   docs/qa/reports/{story-id}-report.md
   {qaLocation}/reports/{epic}.{story}-report.md
   ```

3. Parse the QA report to extract:
   - Story metadata (ID, title, review date)
   - Issue list with severity levels
   - Failed acceptance criteria
   - Test failures

### Phase 2: Extract Issues

1. Filter issues by severity:
   - **CRITICAL**: Always include (blocking)
   - **MAJOR**: Always include (high priority)
   - **MINOR**: Only if `--include-minor` flag set

2. For each issue, extract:
   - Issue ID (auto-generate if missing)
   - Title/description
   - Location (file path, line number if available)
   - Problem description with code snippet
   - Expected behavior with code snippet
   - Verification steps

3. Group issues by category:
   - Code Quality
   - Test Coverage
   - Security
   - Performance
   - Documentation

### Phase 3: Generate Fix Request

1. Create output directory if needed:

   ```
   docs/stories/{story-id}/qa/
   ```

2. Generate `QA_FIX_REQUEST.md` using template below

3. Log generation summary

### Phase 4: Notify

1. Output success message with:
   - File path created
   - Issue count by severity
   - Next steps for @dev

## Issues to Fix

### 1. [CRITICAL] Missing input validation in parseStoryId

**Issue ID:** FIX-6.3-001

**Location:** `src/utils/story-parser.js:45`

**Problem:**
```javascript
function parseStoryId(input) {
  const parts = input.split('.');
  return { epic: parts[0], story: parts[1] };
}
````

**Expected:**

```javascript
function parseStoryId(input) {
  if (!input || typeof input !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Story ID is required and must be a string');
  }
  const match = input.match(/^(\d+)\.(\d+)$/);
  if (!match) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid story ID format: ${input}. Expected format: X.Y`);
  }
  return { epic: match[1], story: match[2] };
}
```

**Verification:**

- [ ] Unit test for null input throws error
- [ ] Unit test for invalid format throws error
- [ ] Unit test for valid format returns correct object

**Status:** [ ] Fixed

## Integration with QA Loop

This task is part of Epic 6 - QA Evolution's 10-phase loop:

```

Phase 1: Story Ready for Review
Phase 2: CodeRabbit Scan (automated)
Phase 3: Manual QA Review
Phase 4: QA Report Generation
Phase 5: Fix Request Generation ← THIS TASK
Phase 6: @dev Applies Fixes
Phase 7: Re-review
Phase 8: Gate Decision
Phase 9: Approval/Rejection
Phase 10: Merge or Iterate

```

**Previous Step:** QA Report generated via `*review {story-id}`
**Next Step:** @dev runs `*apply-qa-fixes {story-id}` using this fix request

---

## Exit Criteria

This task is complete when:
- QA_FIX_REQUEST.md created at correct path
- All CRITICAL issues included
- All MAJOR issues included
- MINOR issues included only if flag set
- Each issue has all required fields
- Constraints section present
