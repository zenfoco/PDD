  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Building production frontend applications
      - Multiple views/pages with complex interactions
      - Need comprehensive UI/UX design and testing
      - Multiple team members will be involved
      - Long-term maintenance expected
      - Customer-facing applications
    when_not_to_use:
      - Full-stack application with backend needs (use greenfield-fullstack)
      - API-only service without frontend (use greenfield-service)
      - Enhancing existing frontend (use brownfield-ui)
      - Technical debt assessment on existing project (use brownfield-discovery)
