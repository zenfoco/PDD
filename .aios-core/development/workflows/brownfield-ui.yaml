  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - UI enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Design system changes needed
      - New component patterns required
      - User research and testing needed
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes
    when_not_to_use:
      - New frontend from scratch (use greenfield-ui)
      - Backend or service enhancement (use brownfield-service)
      - Full-stack enhancement (use brownfield-fullstack)
      - Technical debt assessment (use brownfield-discovery)
