## Execution Modes

**Choose your execution mode:**

### 1. YOLO Mode - Fast, Autonomous (0-1 prompts)
- Autonomous decision making with logging
- Minimal user interaction
- **Best for:** Simple, deterministic tasks

### 2. Interactive Mode - Balanced, Educational (5-10 prompts) **[DEFAULT]**
- Explicit decision checkpoints
- Educational explanations
- **Best for:** Learning, complex decisions

### 3. Pre-Flight Planning - Comprehensive Upfront Planning
- Task analysis phase (identify all ambiguities)
- Zero ambiguity execution
- **Best for:** Ambiguous requirements, critical work

**Parameter:** `mode` (optional, default: `interactive`)

## Step 0: IDS Registry Check (Advisory)

Before proceeding, check the Entity Registry for existing artifacts:

1. Extract intent keywords from user's request
2. Run `FrameworkGovernor.preCheck(intent, 'workflow')`
3. If REUSE match found (>=90% relevance):
   - Display match and ask user: "Existing workflow found. REUSE instead of creating new?"
4. If ADAPT match found (60-89%):
   - Display adaptation candidate: "Similar workflow exists. ADAPT instead of creating new?"
5. If CREATE (no match or user chooses):
   - Log decision with justification and proceed to Step 1
6. If IDS unavailable (timeout/error): Warn and proceed normally

**NOTE:** This step is advisory and does NOT block creation. User always has final decision.

## Pre-Conditions

**Purpose:** Validate prerequisites BEFORE task execution (blocking)

**Checklist:**

```yaml
pre-conditions:
  - [ ] Target does not already exist; required inputs provided; permissions granted
    tipo: pre-condition
    blocker: true
    validação: |
      Check target does not already exist; required inputs provided; permissions granted
    error_message: "Pre-condition failed: Target does not already exist; required inputs provided; permissions granted"
  - [ ] When target_context="squad" or "hybrid", squad directory must exist at squads/{squad_name}/
    tipo: pre-condition
    blocker: true
    validação: |
      If target_context is "squad" or "hybrid", verify squads/{squad_name}/ exists and has a valid squad.yaml
    error_message: "Pre-condition failed: Squad '{squad_name}' not found in squads/"
```

---

## Post-Conditions

**Purpose:** Validate execution success AFTER task completes

**Checklist:**

```yaml
post-conditions:
  - [ ] Resource created successfully; validation passed; no errors logged
    tipo: post-condition
    blocker: true
    validação: |

## Error Handling

**Strategy:** abort

**Common Errors:**

1. **Error:** Resource Already Exists
   - **Cause:** Target file/resource already exists in system
   - **Resolution:** Use force flag or choose different name
   - **Recovery:** Prompt user for alternative name or force overwrite

2. **Error:** Invalid Input
   - **Cause:** Input name contains invalid characters or format
   - **Resolution:** Validate input against naming rules (kebab-case, lowercase, no special chars)
   - **Recovery:** Sanitize input or reject with clear error message

3. **Error:** Permission Denied
   - **Cause:** Insufficient permissions to create resource
   - **Resolution:** Check file system permissions, run with elevated privileges if needed
   - **Recovery:** Log error, notify user, suggest permission fix

---

## Performance

**Expected Metrics:**

```yaml
duration_expected: 2-10 min (estimated)
cost_estimated: $0.001-0.008
token_usage: ~800-2,500 tokens
```

**Optimization Notes:**
- Validate configuration early; use atomic writes; implement rollback checkpoints

# Create Workflow

## Purpose
To create a new workflow definition that orchestrates multiple agents and tasks for complex multi-step processes in Synkra AIOS.

## Prerequisites
- User authorization verified
- Clear understanding of workflow goals
- Knowledge of participating agents and tasks
- Memory layer client initialized

## Interactive Elicitation Process

### Step 0: Target Context
```
ELICIT: Target Context
1. Where should this workflow be created? (core / squad / hybrid)
2. If squad or hybrid: Which squad? (kebab-case name, e.g., "pedro-valerio")
```

### Step 1: Workflow Overview
```
ELICIT: Workflow Basic Information
1. What is the workflow name? (e.g., "feature-development", "bug-fix")
2. What is the primary goal of this workflow?
3. What type of project is this for? (greenfield/brownfield, UI/service/fullstack)
4. What is the expected outcome?
```

### Step 2: Workflow Stages
```
ELICIT: Workflow Stages and Flow
1. What are the main stages/phases? (e.g., "planning", "implementation", "testing")
2. What is the sequence of these stages?
3. Are there any parallel activities?
4. Are there decision points or conditional flows?
5. What are the exit criteria for each stage?
```

### Step 3: Agent Orchestration
```
ELICIT: Agent Participation
For each stage:
1. Which agent(s) are involved?
2. What are their specific responsibilities?
3. How do agents hand off work between stages?
4. Are there any approval requirements?
```

### Step 4: Resource Requirements
```
ELICIT: Resources and Dependencies
1. What templates are needed?
2. What data files are required?
3. Are there external dependencies?
4. What are the input requirements?
5. What outputs are produced?
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Validate Workflow Design**
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Validate agent availability
   - Ensure logical flow progression
   - Verify all resources exist

2. **Generate Workflow Structure**
   ```yaml
   workflow:
     id: {workflow-name}
     name: {Workflow Display Name}
     description: {Purpose and overview}
     type: {greenfield|brownfield}
     scope: {ui|service|fullstack}
     
   stages:
     - id: stage-1
       name: {Stage Name}
       agent: {agent-id}
       tasks:
         - {task-name}
       outputs:
         - {output-description}
       next: stage-2
       
   transitions:
     - from: stage-1
       to: stage-2
       condition: {optional condition}
       
   resources:
     templates:
       - {template-name}
     data:
       - {data-file}
       
   validation:
     checkpoints:
       - stage: {stage-id}
         criteria: {validation-criteria}
   ```

3. **Add Security Controls**
   - Stage authorization requirements
   - Data access restrictions
   - Audit logging points
   - Approval workflows

4. **Create Workflow File**
   - Resolve output path based on target_context:
     - `core` → `.aios-core/development/workflows/{workflow-name}.yaml`
     - `squad` → `squads/{squad_name}/workflows/{workflow-name}.yaml`
     - `hybrid` → `squads/{squad_name}/workflows/{workflow-name}.yaml`
   - Write structured YAML definition
   - Include comprehensive documentation

4.5. **Update Squad Manifest** (when target_context="squad" or "hybrid")
   - Load `squads/{squad_name}/squad.yaml`
   - Initialize `components.workflows` array if it does not exist
   - Add workflow filename to `components.workflows[]` (skip if already present)
   - Create backup of `squad.yaml` before saving
   - Save updated manifest

5. **Update Memory Layer**
   ```javascript
   await memoryClient.addMemory({
     type: 'workflow_created',
     name: workflowName,
     path: workflowPath,
     creator: currentUser,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
     metadata: {
       type: workflowType,
       stages: stageList,
       agents: involvedAgents
     }
   });
   ```

6. **Generate Documentation**
   - Create workflow diagram (text-based)
   - Document each stage's purpose
   - List all handoff points
   - Include troubleshooting guide

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Workflow name is unique and valid
- [ ] All stages have clear purposes
- [ ] Agent assignments are valid
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] All resources exist
- [ ] Transitions are logical
- [ ] Security controls defined
- [ ] Memory layer updated

## Error Handling
- If workflow exists: Offer versioning or update
- If agents missing: List required agents
- If circular dependency: Show cycle and suggest fix
- If resources missing: List and offer to create

## Success Output
```
✅ Workflow '{workflow-name}' created successfully!
📁 Location: {resolved-path}
   (core → .aios-core/development/workflows/{workflow-name}.yaml)
   (squad → squads/{squad_name}/workflows/{workflow-name}.yaml)
   (hybrid → squads/{squad_name}/workflows/{workflow-name}.yaml)
📊 Workflow Summary:
   - Context: {target_context} {squad_name if applicable}
   - Stages: {stage-count}
   - Agents: {agent-list}
   - Type: {workflow-type}
🚀 To use: Select workflow when starting new project
```

## Workflow Execution Notes
- Workflows are selected during project initialization
- Each stage execution is logged in memory
- Progress tracking available through memory queries
- Agents automatically receive stage-specific context
