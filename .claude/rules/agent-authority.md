### @architect (Aria) — Design Authority

| Owns | Delegates To |
|------|-------------|
| System architecture decisions | — |

### @data-engineer (Dara) — Database

| Schema design (detailed DDL) | System architecture |
| Query optimization | Application code |

## Cross-Agent Delegation Patterns

### Git Push Flow
```
ANY agent → @devops *push
```

### Schema Design Flow
```
@architect (decides technology) → @data-engineer (implements DDL)
```

### Story Flow
```
@sm *draft → @po *validate → @dev *develop → @qa *qa-gate → @devops *push
```

### Epic Flow
```
@pm *create-epic → @pm *execute-epic → @sm *draft (per story)
```

## Escalation Rules

1. Agent cannot complete task → Escalate to @aios-master
2. Quality gate fails → Return to @dev with specific feedback
3. Constitutional violation detected → BLOCK, require fix before proceed
4. Agent boundary conflict → @aios-master mediates
