# QA Issue Fixer Task

> **Phase:** QA Fix Loop
> **Owner Agent:** @dev
> **Pipeline:** qa-loop
> **Command:** `*fix-qa-issues {story-id}`

---

## Purpose

Fix issues reported in QA review following a structured 8-phase workflow. This task is triggered when QA identifies issues that need to be addressed before the story can be approved.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**

- **Minimal changes only** - Fix ONLY what's in the fix request
- **No scope creep** - Do NOT refactor or add features
- **Run ALL verification steps** from the fix request
- **Commit with proper references** to issue IDs

## The 8 Phases of QA Issue Fixing

### CRITICAL RULE: No Scope Creep

```yaml
scope_enforcement:
  description: |
    Fix ONLY what is explicitly listed in the QA_FIX_REQUEST.md.
    Do NOT:
    - Refactor code "while you're in there"
    - Add features that "would be nice"
    - Fix issues that weren't reported
    - Improve code style beyond what's required

  on_violation:
    action: halt
    message: 'Scope creep detected. Only fix issues from QA_FIX_REQUEST.md'
```

## Phase-by-Phase Execution Flow

## Integration with QA Loop

```yaml
qa_loop_integration:
  triggered_by:
    - QA review identifies issues
    - QA_FIX_REQUEST.md created
    - @qa signals @dev

  triggers_next:
    - READY_FOR_REREVIEW.md signals @qa
    - @qa runs re-review
    - Loop continues until PASS or WAIVED

  handoff_format:
    from_qa_to_dev: QA_FIX_REQUEST.md
    from_dev_to_qa: READY_FOR_REREVIEW.md

  status_tracking:
    - pending_fixes: "QA issues identified, awaiting dev"
    - in_progress_fixes: "Dev fixing issues"
    - fixes_complete: "Dev done, awaiting QA re-review"
    - passed: "All issues resolved"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Fix

```bash
*fix-qa-issues 6.4
```

**Output:**

```
## QA Fixes Complete for 6.4

**Issues Fixed:** 2/2
**Commit:** abc123def
**Status:** Ready for QA Re-Review

### Issues Addressed
- ✅ CRIT-1 (CRITICAL): Missing null check in validator
- ✅ MAJ-1 (MAJOR): Error message not user-friendly

### Verification Results
- ✅ Run npm test
- ✅ Check null input returns proper error

### Next Steps
1. QA agent should re-review: `@qa *review-story 6.4`
2. If all issues verified, story moves to "Ready for Review"
```

### Example 2: Partial Fix (Some Issues Cannot Be Fixed)

```bash
*fix-qa-issues 6.5
```

**Output:**

```
## QA Fixes Partially Complete for 6.5

**Issues Fixed:** 2/3
**Commit:** def456ghi
**Status:** Needs Manual Review

### Issues Addressed
- ✅ CRIT-1 (CRITICAL): SQL injection vulnerability
- ✅ MAJ-1 (MAJOR): Missing input validation
- ⚠️ MAJ-2 (MAJOR): Performance regression - requires scope expansion

### Notes
MAJ-2 requires refactoring the data layer. This exceeds minimal fix scope.
Recommend creating separate story for performance optimization.

### Next Steps
1. Discuss MAJ-2 with @qa and @po
2. Either expand scope or create follow-up story
