        Determine enhancement complexity to route to appropriate path:
        - Single story (< 4 hours) → Use brownfield-create-story task
        - Small feature (1-3 stories) → Use brownfield-create-epic task
        - Major enhancement (multiple epics) → Continue with full workflow

        Ask user: "Can you describe the enhancement scope? Is this a small fix, a feature addition, or a major enhancement requiring architectural changes?"

      notes: |
        Check if adequate project documentation exists:
        - Look for existing architecture docs, API specs, coding standards
        - Assess if documentation is current and comprehensive
        - If adequate: Skip document-project, proceed to PRD
        - If inadequate: Run document-project first

        Creates PRD for major enhancement. If document-project was run, reference its output to avoid re-analysis.
        If skipped, use existing project documentation.
        SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder.

      duration_estimate: "10-15 min"
      condition: after_prd_creation
      notes: |
        Review PRD to determine if architectural planning is needed:
        - New architectural patterns → Create architecture doc
        - New libraries/frameworks → Create architecture doc
        - Platform/infrastructure changes → Create architecture doc
        - Following existing patterns → Skip to story creation

        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Architectural changes are needed
      - Significant integration work required
      - Risk assessment and mitigation planning necessary
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes

    when_not_to_use:
      - New project from scratch (use greenfield-fullstack)
      - Service-only enhancement (use brownfield-service)
      - Frontend-only enhancement (use brownfield-ui)
      - Technical debt assessment only (use brownfield-discovery)
