---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Leading questions** - Don't ask "Don't you think X is better?" → Ask "How do you compare X and Y?"
2. **Too small sample** - 1-2 interviews isn't enough → Aim for 5-10 minimum
3. **Confirmation bias** - Don't only talk to happy users → Include frustrated users
4. **No synthesis** - Don't just collect data → Find patterns and themes
5. **Ignoring context** - Don't just ask questions → Observe actual behavior
