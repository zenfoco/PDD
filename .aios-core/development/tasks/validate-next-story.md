# Validate Next Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient context for successful development. This task identifies issues and gaps that need to be addressed, preventing hallucinations and ensuring implementation readiness.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs

- Load `.aios-core/core-config.yaml`
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story validation."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`
- Identify and load the following inputs:
  - **Story file**: The drafted story to validate (provided by user or discovered in `devStoryLocation`)
  - **Parent epic**: The epic containing this story's requirements
  - **Architecture documents**: Based on configuration (sharded or monolithic)
  - **Story template**: `aios-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` for completeness validation

### 1. Template Completeness Validation

- Load `aios-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` and extract all section headings from the template
- **Missing sections check**: Compare story sections against template sections to verify all required sections are present
- **Placeholder validation**: Ensure no template placeholders remain unfilled (e.g., `{{EpicNum}}`, `{{role}}`, `_TBD_`)
- **Agent section verification**: Confirm all sections from template exist for future agent use
- **Structure compliance**: Verify story follows template structure and formatting

### 1.1 Executor Assignment Validation (Story 11.1 - Projeto Bob)

**PRD Reference:** AIOS v2.0 "Projeto Bob" - Section 5 (Dynamic Executor Assignment)

**Required Fields Check:**
- [ ] **executor** field present and not empty
- [ ] **quality_gate** field present and not empty
- [ ] **quality_gate_tools** field present as non-empty array

**Constraint Validation:**
- [ ] **executor != quality_gate** (CRITICAL - must be different)
- [ ] **executor** is a known agent: @dev, @data-engineer, @devops, @ux-design-expert, @analyst, @architect
- [ ] **quality_gate** is a known agent: @architect, @dev, @pm

**Type-to-Executor Consistency:**
| Work Type | Expected Executor | Expected Quality Gate |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Code/Features/Logic | @dev | @architect |
| Schema/DB/RLS/Migrations | @data-engineer | @dev |
| Infra/CI/CD/Deploy | @devops | @architect |
| Design/UI Components | @ux-design-expert | @dev |
| Research/Investigation | @analyst | @pm |
| Architecture Decisions | @architect | @pm |

- [ ] Story content keywords match assigned executor type
- [ ] Quality gate tools are appropriate for the executor type

**Validation Result:**
- [ ] PASS: All executor assignment fields valid
- [ ] FAIL: Missing fields, invalid assignment, or executor == quality_gate

### 8. CodeRabbit Integration Validation (CONDITIONAL)

**CONDITIONAL STEP** - Check `coderabbit_integration.enabled` in core-config.yaml

**IF `coderabbit_integration.enabled: false`:**
- SKIP this entire step
- Verify the story contains the skip notice in the CodeRabbit Integration section:
  > **CodeRabbit Integration**: Disabled
- Log: "ℹ️ CodeRabbit validation skipped - disabled in core-config.yaml"
- Proceed to Step 9

**IF `coderabbit_integration.enabled: true`:**
- Validate ALL of the following:

- Is the `🤖 CodeRabbit Integration` section present?
- Are all subsections populated (Story Type Analysis, Specialized Agents, Quality Gates, Self-Healing, Focus Areas)?

**Story Type Analysis:**
- Is the primary story type correctly identified?
- Does the complexity level match the story scope?
- Are secondary types listed if applicable?

**Specialized Agent Assignment:**
- Is @dev listed as primary agent (required for all stories)?
- Are type-specific agents assigned appropriately?
  - Database stories → @db-sage
  - Frontend stories → @ux-expert
  - Deployment stories → @github-devops
  - Security stories → @architect

**Quality Gate Tasks:**

  - Frontend: accessibility, performance, responsive

**Validation Result:**
- [ ] PASS: CodeRabbit section complete and accurate
- [ ] PARTIAL: Section present but incomplete
- [ ] FAIL: Section missing or critically incomplete
- [ ] N/A: CodeRabbit disabled in core-config.yaml

### 9. Anti-Hallucination Verification

- **Epic Context Enrichment**: Import `EpicContextAccumulator` from `core/orchestration` and call `buildAccumulatedContext(epicId, storyN)` to enrich validation with accumulated epic context (progressive summarization within token limits)
- **Refer to tools/mcp/context7.yaml** for library documentation lookup to verify technical claims against official sources
- Consult the examples section for documentation verification patterns and library-specific queries
- **Source verification**: Every technical claim must be traceable to source documents
- **Architecture alignment**: Dev Notes content matches architecture specifications
- **No invented details**: Flag any technical decisions not supported by source documents
- **Reference accuracy**: Verify all source references are correct and accessible
- **Fact checking**: Cross-reference claims against epic and architecture documents

### 10. Dev Agent Implementation Readiness

- **Self-contained context**: Can the story be implemented without reading external docs?
- **Clear instructions**: Are implementation steps unambiguous?
- **Complete technical context**: Are all required technical details present in Dev Notes?
- **Missing information**: Identify any critical information gaps
- **Actionability**: Are all tasks actionable by a development agent?
