   - **Resolution:** Use force flag or choose different name
   - **Recovery:** Prompt user for alternative name or force overwrite

2. **Error:** Invalid Input
   - **Cause:** Input name contains invalid characters or format
   - **Resolution:** Validate input against naming rules (kebab-case, lowercase, no special chars)
   - **Recovery:** Sanitize input or reject with clear error message

3. **Error:** Permission Denied
   - **Cause:** Insufficient permissions to create resource
   - **Resolution:** Check file system permissions, run with elevated privileges if needed
   - **Recovery:** Log error, notify user, suggest permission fix
